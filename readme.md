# Data Visualization of Residential Eviction and Violence Among PWID in Vancouver

## Project Overview
This project visualizes the relationship between residential eviction and experiences of violence among People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) in Vancouver, Canada. The visualization is based on research findings from Kennedy et al. (2017) and aims to raise awareness about the heightened risks faced by this vulnerable population.

## Key Findings
- Male PWID who experience housing eviction are 1.95 times more likely to experience violence
- Female PWID who experience housing eviction are 2.09 times more likely to experience violence
- Among those who reported violence, 68.82% were male (245 individuals) and 31.18% were female (111 individuals)

## Live Demo

## Design Process
The visualization follows Tamara Munzner's visual encoding theory and task abstraction model, incorporating:
1. Scatter plot showing unadjusted odds ratios across variables
2. Bar chart presenting adjusted odds ratios for residential eviction
3. Gender distribution visualization
4. Interactive dashboard combining all visualizations

## Technical Implementation
- Built with HTML5 and CSS3
- Styled using Tailwind CSS
- Icons from Lucide
- Interactive visualizations created with Tableau
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
